## Introduction
Touhou Launcher is a desktop app for Windows that provides a quick and easy way to access and run [Touhou](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touhou_Project) games. It's written in C# with WPF and runs on .NET 6. The app serves as a modern and simplified alternative to an [old launcher](http://www.widdiful.co.uk/touhou.html) with the same name. 

### Key features
- Connect and launch your Touhou games from a game library
- Help you find downloads for official Touhou games
- Help find a download and connect a PC-98 emulator for playing the oldes games (Touhou 01 - 05). No emulator configuration required!
- An editor for adding fan made games with the same look and treatment as official games
- Organizing your list of games into categories
- Launch a random game
